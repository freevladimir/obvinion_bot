This means that <strong>no one can crack the code</strong>: neither the <strong>Obvion</strong> project developers, nor the creators of Blockchain TRON, nor anyone else. Therefore, all partners can be sure that their funds cannot be stolen from the system, spent for personal purposes or used improperly. \n\nAll links to the source codes of smart contracts can be found on the <strong>official website</strong> of the obvion.io project and in the <strong>chat-bot</strong> in the “<strong>Smart Contracts</strong>” section.\nYou can explore them directly and ascertain that the project is completely transparent.",
  "textFaqConfidentDataText": "<strong>Registration</strong> and <strong>login</strong> to the <strong>Obvion</strong> project is done via the <strong>TronLink</strong> wallet by checking the digital signature and authentication of the signed message. Verification of the digital signature on the TRON network is done automatically when you log in to the TronLink wallet, i. e. the user <strong>DOES NOT enter</strong> the confidential information of the wallet, such as password, private key or mnemonic phrase. The only information that is available to the <strong>Obvion</strong> system is the public address of the user's wallet in the following format: TJGSm68nwU8NA9BvsSnmGPzMp37gGrvwjz\nSmart contract identifies the user and makes payments by this address of the wallet.",

  "textFaqPayWalletTronText": "To replenish the <strong>TronLink</strong> wallet you need to send <strong>TRX</strong> to your TronLink wallet address.\n\n<strong>TRX</strong> can be purchased on any cryptocurrency exchange or through a cryptocurrency exchange aggregator.\n\n5.

On average, the fee for replenishing a smart contract is from <strong>2 to 6 TRX</strong>.\n\nOnce the transaction is confirmed, your deposit will be displayed in your <strong>Obvion</strong> project personal account.",
  "textFaqModAdditionTronText": "You can synchronize your <strong>TronLink</strong> wallet with the mobile app using a browser extension. To do this, download the mobile version of your wallet on the official website tronlink.org и and select «<strong>Import Account</strong>» during installation.\n\n<strong>You'll be offered several actions</strong>:\n\n- input a mnemonic phrase consisting of 12-24 words;\n- private key input;\n- Keystore file upload and password input.\n\nAfter synchronization, you will be able to use your <strong>Obvion</strong> project personal account directly from the TronLink mobile app. To do this, go to the «<strong>Browser</strong>» section, enter the project website: obvion.io and you will be automatically redirected to your personal account.",
  "textFaqBusinessManagementText": "<strong>Obvion</strong> personal account is just a visual display of data downloaded from the <strong>Blockchain TRON</strong>. Therefore, even if for some reason the data from the website or personal account stop loading, <strong>Blockchain TRON</strong> will work in the same mode, and smart contracts will keep performing their functions of passive income and referral income accrual and <strong>OBI</strong> token distribution.\n\nEvery action in a smart contract <strong>is only caused by a transaction</strong>, which means that you can always <strong>invoke any transaction</strong> without being linked to your personal account, i.e. directly from your <strong>TronLink wallet</strong>.\n\nHere is a list of transactions to help you invoke any smart contract action directly from your <strong>TronLink wallet</strong>:\n\n<strong>1) Registration of a partner</strong>:\nYou can register in the structure of the person who invited you, directly from your <strong>TronLink</strong>, wallet, without using the website and personal account.\n\n<strong>Guideline</strong>:\n1. Open your <strong>TronLink</strong> wallet and click «<strong>Send</strong>»;\n2. In the «<strong>Receiving account</strong>» field, enter the address of the <strong>Obvion</strong> smart contract:\nTJGSm68nwU8NA9BvsSnmGPzMp37gGrvwjz;\n3. In the «<strong>Transfer amount</strong>» field, enter the recharge amount (be sure to save some <strong>TRX</strong> to pay the fee);\n4. In the «<strong>Add transfer notes</strong>» field, enter the address of the partner who invited you and click «<strong>Send</strong>».\n\nNow you are registered in the Obvion project in the first line of the partner, whose address you’ve entered in the «<strong>Add transfer notes</strong>» field.\nAll partner accruals are made <strong>automatically</strong> upon transaction confirmation.\n\n2) <strong>Passive income accrual</strong>:\nTo get the passive income reserved for you in the project, you need to send a zero transaction to the <strong>Obvion</strong> smart contract address.\n \n\n\n<strong>Guideline</strong>:\n1. Open your <strong>TronLink</strong> wallet and click «<strong>Send</strong>»;\n2. In the «<strong>Receiving account</strong>» field, enter the address of the <strong>Obvion</strong> smart contract:\nTJGSm68nwU8NA9BvsSnmGPzMp37gGrvwjz\n3. In the «<strong>Transfer amount</strong>» field, enter “0” and click send (be sure to save some <strong>TRX</strong> to pay the fee).\n\nAfter confirming the transaction, the passive income reserved for you will be credited to your wallet.\n\n3) <strong>OBI</strong> tokens sale:\nOBI tokens are sold by transferring them to the <strong>OBI</strong> token smart contract address.\n\nGuideline:\n1. Open your TronLink wallet, select <strong>OBI</strong> and click «<strong>Send</strong>»;\n2. In the «<strong>Receiving account</strong>» field, enter the address of the Obvion smart contract:\nTJGSm68nwU8NA9BvsSnmGPzMp37gGrvwjz\n3. In the «<strong>Transfer amount</strong>» field,  enter the amount of <strong>OBI</strong> for sale and click send (be sure to save some <strong>TRX</strong> to pay the fee).\n\nAfter confirming the transaction, you will automatically receive a proportional amount of <strong>TRX</strong> in the pool, and the sent <strong>OBI</strong> tokens will be burned and will never participate in the capitalization assessment again.",
  "textFaqSafeWalletStorageText": "1) Back up your mnemonic phrase or private key and store this data in a safe place.\nThe most common way is to write down a phrase of 12-24 words on a piece of paper.\nMnemonic phrase and private key is the only way to restore your funds in case of device failure or loss of your wallet.\n\n2) If you lose a mnemonic phrase or private key, both <strong>TronLink</strong> and <strong>Obvion project will NOT be able to help you</strong> restore wallet access.\n\n3) <strong>Never</strong> disclose the mnemonic phrase or private key of your wallet to third parties.\n\n4) Do not use <strong>TronLink</strong> on public PC devices: at work, in computer clubs or university classrooms. Use only your personal device to access the wallet.",
  "textFaqForgotPasswordTronText": "The <strong>Obvion project does NOT own any confidential user data</strong> and does not provide support to restore wallet access.\n\nWe always recommend that you write down mnemonic phrases, private keys and passwords on physical media: paper or notebooks and store them in a safe place.",
  "textFaqWhyObiAlwaysGrowText": "The smart contract algorithm is developed in such a way that any sale of <strong>OBI</strong> tokens by project participants will cause their burning, which will systematically reduce the number of tokens in circulation.\n\nAt the same time, <strong>5% of all investments</strong> go to the <strong>OBI</strong> token smart contract, which will ensure a gradual increase in its capitalization. After a while, the <strong>OBI</strong> pool will be replenished with new <strong>TRX</strong> and there will be no more tokens in circulation.\nSuch an algorithm will cause the <strong>OBI</strong> token to grow organically in price.",
  "textFaqContractActivityText": "If your contract has expired, it means that your account is no longer active and you cannot receive passive or referral income.\n\nThe account activity ends in 52 weekly payments under the «<strong>Contract 1</strong>», or any other contract that meets the following conditions: <strong>[«New contract» >/= «Contract 1» and >/= 10,000 TRX]</strong>. In other words, in order to be able to close career levels and receive referral income from 3 to 12 lines, you need to have an active contract, which is more or equal to the «<strong>Contract 1</strong>» and more or equal to <strong>10,000 TRX</strong>.\n\nIf the user has expired «<strong>Contract 1</strong>», and all other Contracts do not meet the conditions: <strong>[«New contract» >/=  «Contract 1» and >/= 10,000 TRX]</strong>, but at least one of the Contracts remains valid (is replenished in the amount of <strong>1000 to 5000 TRX</strong>), the user continues to receive passive income, and referral income <strong>TRX</strong> and <strong>OBI</strong> is received only from the first two lines, because he has no possibility to close career levels.\n\nThe User is entitled to receive referral income TRX and OBI from the first two lines as long as at least one unsatisfied Contract remains valid.\n\nIn case a user <strong>replenishes the Contract again and its replenishment meets all the conditions</strong>, he will get the «<strong>Level</strong>» back and get the possibility to earn referral income from 3 to 12 lines.",
  "textFaqMyContractHasLostText": "If your contract is no longer active, it means that your 52-week period of receiving passive income has ended. If you want to extend the contract, you need to replenish your smart contract <strong>with an amount greater</strong> than your «<strong>Contract 1</strong>», but not less than <strong>10,000 TRX</strong>. In this case your contract <strong>will be active</strong> for the next <strong>52 weeks</strong> with the possibility of opening levels and receiving passive income.",
